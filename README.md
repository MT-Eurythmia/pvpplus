# PvP Plus

This mod adds many PvP features that allow players to enable / disable their own PvP and to do PvP tournaments.
Some code and images are from the PvP-Button Mod by Phiwari123.

## Usage

PvP can be enabled/disabled from the inventory, or using the commands `/pvp_enable` and `/pvp_disable`.

A new tournament can be initiated by a player by typing /tournament.
Then, each playing wanting to play in the tournament has to type /engage during the next minute (this delay is customizable using the `pvpplus.tournament_starting_time` setting, specified in seconds).
Any engaged player can leave the current tournament by using `/leave_tournament`.  
Varions infos about the current tournament can be seen using `/tournament_info`.

Some additional commands are only executable by the players possessing the `tournament_mod` privilege:
* `/start_global_tournament`: immediately starts a tournament engaging every connected players (except those who don't have the interact privilege)
* `/stop_tournament`: stops the current tournament
* `/remove_from_tournament <name>`: removes a player from the current tournament
* `/add_to_tournament <name>`: adds a player to the current tournament

## Settings

* `pvpplus.enable_sound_loop = true`: whether to play a looped epic music during the tournament
